Try to make the project descriptions easily parseable. I've been using this format -
Project Name and Date
Brief description.
- How many people and how long
- Personal contributions
- Anything else that's relevant
list | tech | used | here
You can do whatever you want, but it's good to have all the relevant information separated out and easy to scan.
Try to get rid of all the "I am"s.
You could get rid of the blurb in the What I do section, add Python, SQL and any databases you've used, PostgreSQL sqLite etc
Change the favicon, gives it a little more professional touch compared to the default
